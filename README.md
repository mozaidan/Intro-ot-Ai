In our project, we chose regression instead of classification because stock prices are continuous, not binary or discrete. We initially tried linear regression, but after some experimentation, we found that polynomial regression performed better. This choice allowed us to handle the unpredictable ups and downs of stock prices more effectively, resulting in a more accurate predictive model.

Our project involves several key steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it's ready for analysis.

- Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to understand its patterns and trends.

- Polynomial Regression Modeling: Using polynomial regression to capture complex relationships and make accurate predictions.

- Feature Engineering: Enhancing the data to improve the model's accuracy.

- Training and Model Evaluation: Teaching the model and thoroughly assessing its performance in predicting stock prices.


This structured approach helped us navigate each project phase systematically, leading to a more informed and optimized predictive model.
