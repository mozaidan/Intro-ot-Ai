# Stock Price Prediction Project with AI

In this project, we explore the use of regression techniques to predict stock prices, focusing on the continuous nature of stock data. Initially, we experimented with linear regression but found that polynomial regression provided a more accurate model for capturing the complex and fluctuating nature of stock prices.

## Project Overview

### Why Regression?
We opted for regression instead of classification due to the continuous nature of stock prices. While classification is suited for discrete categories, regression models are better equipped to handle continuous variables, like stock prices.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning and organizing the raw data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Exploring and visualizing the data to identify patterns and trends.

3. **Polynomial Regression Modeling**:
   - Applying polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating additional features from the date to enhance model performance.

5. **Training and Model Evaluation**:
   - Training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance to ensure reliable predictions.

### Results
Through this structured approach, we achieved a more accurate predictive model for stock prices. Polynomial regression was particularly effective in handling the volatility and complexity of stock price movements.

This project showcases a practical application of regression techniques in financial forecasting, providing insights into the effectiveness of different modeling approaches for continuous data.
